### Knight_Travails 

Your task is to build a function knight_moves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
For this project we rely on DFS or BFS search algorithms. Creating a board in which you can see the knight at his starting point and the route to his destination.
The board is as it should be in chess. For reasons of maintaining what is requested in the project, the rows and columns are respected as numbers, in the end I apply a variation to be able to enter the letters as columns and rows as numbers.
